insights 
---

  (i) correlation - most of the columns are highly correlated, that was to be expected, since most variables are depend on each other, e.g., rigid + flexible = total c production,                         total -> -rank
                    rigid overall has a less strong correlation with the other variables, which might hint to there being a a different sub-population based on rigid production, 
                    flexible has a stronger correlation with total as rigid and total, since flexible is a far bigger contribution to total
                    flexible has a stronger correlation with the overall production, than rigid, this is interesting and also might hint to rigid producers have a different market                        strategy than flexible producers
  (i) a Gini coefficient of 0.56 is quite high, which means that only a top few producers are responsible for a large amount of the total SUP waste contribution, in other words 10%         are responsible for 44% of the waste
  (i) I need more knowledge how to work with and interpret SOM and PCA, maybe also not enough observations in data set,                           
      but the clustering from SOM, when only independent variables are used, actually show the two assumed subpopulations based on rigid vs flexible production
  (i) parallel coordinate plot is not very insightful, since there is so much data close together, we cannot see any grouping without prior knowledge, only hint is when you zoom in at       the bulk of the data in the lower third (y direction), there is a negative correlation
  (i) remind that the difference with the partition by k-means is that for hierarchical clustering, the number of classes is not specified in advance   
      it seems that most clusters are confused by some specific values (81, 63, 72, 36?), are they some sort of outlier, or what is special about them?
  (i) As a reminder, this method aims at partitioning n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the closest average, serving as a prototype       of the cluster
      works not quite as well as SOM, but very close, also recommend cluster is three, but closely followed by 2, since 3 does not reveal any significant connection right now, I            wonder what that shows

correlation

most of the columns are highly correlated, that was to be expected, since most variables are depend on each other, e.g., rigid + flexible = total c production, total -> -rank
rigid overall has a less strong correlation with the other variables, which might hint to there being a a different sub-population based on rigid production, 
flexible has a stronger correlation with total as rigid and total, since flexible is a far bigger contribution to total
flexible has a stronger correlation with the overall production, than rigid, this is interesting and also might hint to rigid producers have a different market strategy than flexible producers

%>% select(-rank, -total, -assets) can show a more clear picture by removing dependent variables

```{r}

          product = production_of_in_scope_polymers, 
          flexible = flexible_format_contribution_to_sup_waste, 
          rigid = rigid_format_contribution_to_sup_waste, 
          total = total_contribution_to_sup_waste)

parallel coordinate plot

parallel coordinate plot is not very insightful, since there is so much data close together, we cannot see any grouping without prior knowledge, only hint is when you zoom in at the bulk of the data in the lower third (y direction), there is a negative correlation

hierarchical clustering
---
https://statsandr.com/blog/clustering-analysis-k-means-and-hierarchical-clustering-by-hand-and-in-r/#optimal-number-of-clusters
remind that the difference with the partition by k-means is that for hierarchical clustering, the number of classes is not specified in advance

it seems that most clusters are confused by some specific values (81, 63, 72, 36?), are they some sort of outlier, or what is special about them?

```{r}
name = c('polymer_producer')
df <- plastic %>% select(- total_waste_div_production, -rank, -no_of_assets, -total_contribution_to_sup_waste) %>% # removed variables which are depended on each other
  rename( product = production_of_in_scope_polymers, 
          flexible = flexible_format_contribution_to_sup_waste, 
          rigid = rigid_format_contribution_to_sup_waste)

scale_data <- as.matrix(t(scale(t(df[, !names(df) %in% name])))) # We need to normalize the data based on scale function because the variables are different scales; Normalization means subtracting mean from each observation and dividing with standard deviation. Check all the variables mean values are zero now
head(scale_data)

no_k = 2;

# Hierarchical clustering: single linkage
hclust_res <- hclust(dist(scale_data), method = 'single')
fviz_dend(hclust_res, k = no_k, rect = TRUE)

# Hierarchical clustering: complete linkage
hclust_res <- hclust(dist(scale_data), method = 'complete')
plot(hclust_res)
rect.hclust(hclust_res, k = no_k, border = 'blue')

# Hierarchical clustering: average linkage
hclust_res <- hclust(dist(scale_data), method = 'average')
plot(hclust_res)
rect.hclust(hclust_res, k = no_k, border = 'blue')

# Hierarchical clustering: ward
hclust_res <- hclust(dist(scale_data), method = 'ward.D')
fviz_dend(hclust_res, k = no_k, rect = TRUE)

# Hierarchical clustering: mcquitty
hclust_res <- hclust(dist(scale_data), method = 'mcquitty')
plot(hclust_res)
rect.hclust(hclust_res, k = no_k, border = 'blue')

# Hierarchical clustering: centroid
hclust_res <- hclust(dist(scale_data), method = 'centroid')
plot(hclust_res)
rect.hclust(hclust_res, k = no_k, border = 'blue')

Clustree

In this figure the size of each node corresponds to the number of samples in each cluster, and the arrows are coloured according to the number of samples each cluster receives. A separate set of arrows, the transparent ones, called the incoming node proportion, are also coloured and shows how samples from one group end up in another group — an indicator of cluster instability.

cValid to choose best clustering algo
---
https://towardsdatascience.com/10-tips-for-choosing-the-optimal-number-of-clusters-277e93d72d92
The cValid package can be used to simultaneously compare multiple clustering algorithms, to identify the best clustering approach and the optimal number of clusters. We will compare k-means, hierarchical and PAM clustering.

```{r}

```
